# Friend-Finder
FriendFinder is supposed to be a full stack friend/dating app. There is a ten-question survey that the user takes and would then be compared to records of other user's answers. Through some algorithm, the app would match you up with friends with similar interest/disinterests.

The site was able to be deployed to Heroku, and the url pathing was all correct. But the site could not be completed to the point where it would store the user's answer into the data.js file.
